## Overview

This project is designed to simulate process scheduling algorithms and provide insights into the performance of these algorithms. Follow the steps below to execute the program successfully.

## Getting Started
### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone [repo_url]
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd /file_path
```
### Building the Project
Ensure the necessary binaries are generated by running the following command:
```
./make
```
### Generating Processes File
Compile and execute the generateRandomProcesses.c program:
```
gcc -o generateRandomProcesses generateRandomProcesses.c
chmod a+x generateRandomProcesses
./generateRandomProcesses
```

### Running the Code with Generated Processes
Execute the main program with the generated processes.txt file
```
./main ./processes.txt
```
Follow on-screen prompts to select a scheduling algorithm.

### Result
Upon completion, the program will display:

- Processes Table
- Turnaround data
- Gantt chart of the chosen algorithm

Interact with the program as instructed on the console.
